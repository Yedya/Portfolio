### Leap Runner [2D AR]
Alternate Reality (AR) 2D Endless runner built for Leap Motion Controller; user controls player using hand gestures.
- Developed a AR controlled 2D endless runner with a library of intuitive  hand controlled gestures 
- Engineered custom library in C# and Unity of 8 responsive hand gestures for each action player performs.
- Includes a feedback HUD so the system can calibrate the trigger parameters based on the users's hand size.This gives the user real time feedback on the hand position in 3D space. This will act as  a substitute for haptic feedback 
- The feedback HUD gives the user an action point when performing gestures which will increase the level of learnability.


**Built With :** Unity,Photoshop, C# and the Leap Motion API

**Languages Used :** C#

## General Software Projects

### Distributed Database using a REST API
I developed a game rental database system.

- The application uses HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE  to respond to REST requests. In other words it has the ability to perform create, read, update and delete on the database of games a customer can rent.
- The database has a table called games. The games table contains 4 attributes, an int ‘id’ for ID, a string ‘title’ for the game title,  a string ‘genre’ for the genre and an int ‘rating’ for the game rating.




**Built With :** Eclipse, JAXB, JAX-RS & HSQLDB.

**Languages Used :** Java, SQL & XML.

### Packet Sniffer
A packet sniffer is a program that listens for network traffic.

- Displays the interfaces on my laptop, my NIC is  a Atheros Ar81xx seris PCI-E. 
- You can select devices with the dropdown menu, and capture various packets from that device.
- Displays device mac address(link layer), device address and subnet mask, in this case there are 256 available hosts per device. I know this because their subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 .



**Built With :** Netbeans.

**Languages Used :** Java.
