## Welcome to GitHub Pages!


I am a driven person who loves to learn about new technologies and improve my skills

I am never satisfied with a project until I know it has been completed to the best of my abilities,which makes me somewhat of  a perfectionist.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Yedya/Porfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
